## Standard Model
SRC : https://home.cern/science/physics/standard-model

The Standard Model (SM) of particle physics is the most comprehensive theory describing the fundamental building blocks of the universe and three of the four fundamental forces (electromagnetism, strong and weak nuclear forces) they interact with. It is not a "Theory of Everything" because it notably excludes gravity.
### Fundamental Particles
The Standard Model classifies all known fundamental particles into two groups: Fermions (the matter constituents) and Bosons (the force carriers).
#### Fermions
Fermions are the particles that make up all visible matter. There are 12 types, arranged in three generations. Ordinary matter is made only of the first generation.
##### 1st generation
The Quarks are make up by the Up (u) and Down (d). They combine to form protons (uud) and neutrons (udd) and are affected by the strong force.
For the Leptons, we find the famous electron (e) and Electron Neutrino \(\nu_e\)​. They are sensitive to the electromagnetic and weak forces, but not the strong force.
#### Other Generations
Thoses partcles are heavier copies which quickly decay of the first generation particles.
#### Bosons
We find the photon \(\gamma\), the W and Z Bosons (responsible for radioactive decay), the Gluons (g) (responsible for the Strong force) and of course the Higgs Boson, that interests us.
### Spin
#### Definition
The spin of a particle is an intrinsic form of angular momentum. It is an inherent property of the particle, much like its mass or electric charge. It does not come from the particle moving in space.
#### Direction
The spin value dictates how many spatial orientations a particle can have:

- Spin J=1 : Particles like the photon and W/Z bosons are associated with vector fields. They can have three physical polarization states (degrees of freedom), corresponding to the three spatial directions.
- Spin J=0 : A scalar field (like the Higgs field) is defined by its magnitude only, which has no directional dependence. Therefore, its corresponding particle, the Higgs Boson, must have only one internal degree of freedom, corresponding to zero spin.
### Limits
Despite its accuracy, the Standard Model is incomplete, failing to explain several phenomena, like the gravity (it does not include the gravitational force or its hypothesized carrier, the graviton) and the dark Matter. Indeed,  the SM particles account for only about 5% of the universe's mass-energy. The nature of Dark Matter (about 27%) is completely unknown.

###  Quantum Scalar Field
SRC



A Quantum Scalar Field is a fundamental concept in Quantum Field Theory, which is the mathematical framework that describes the Standard Model of particle physics. It combines three distinct ideas: Field, Quantum, and Scalar.
#### Field
A field is a physical quantity that has a value at every point in space and time. Instead of thinking of particles as tiny balls, QFT views particles as excitations or vibrations of these omnipresent fields.
#### Quantum 
The term quantum  means the field is governed by the laws of quantum mechanics :

The energy of the field's vibrations can only occur in discrete packets (quanta), not continuously.

Here, the Higgs Boson is the specific quantum (the particle) of the Higgs Field.
#### Scalar
Scalar describes the field's fundamental property: how it behaves when you rotate the space around it.

Definition: A scalar quantity is defined by its magnitude (value) only, and has no direction in space. It's represented by a single number at every point (like temperature).

On the contrary, a Vector Field (like the electromagnetic field) has both magnitude and direction.

Because the Higgs Field is scalar, its corresponding particle, the Higgs Boson, must have zero spin. This is a key experimental confirmation that distinguishes the Higgs from all force-carrying bosons, which have spin J=1.
