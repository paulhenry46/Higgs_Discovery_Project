    "\n",
    "It checks for `\"DoubleMuon\"` or `\"DoubleElectron\"` in the `file_key`. This is a way to get the **lepton flavor** ($\\mu$ or $e$) and select the correct set of **TTree branches** (e.g., `Muon_pt` vs. `Electron_pt`).\n",
    "\n",
    "Then we set the `lepton_prefix` (e.g., `\"Muon\"`) and the **PDG ID** (`flavor_pdg`, 13 or 11), ensuring the output DataFrame is properly annotated.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Event Array Retrieval (The Reader)\n",
    "\n",
    "Using the `uproot` library, the function streams data from the ROOT file's `Events` TTree: It only reads the necessary branches (defined by `MUON_BRANCHES` or `ELECTRON_BRANCHES`), minimizing I/O and memory overhead.\n",
    "\n",
    "The data is loaded into an **Awkward Array (`ak`)**. This choice is crucial because it inherently handles the **variable-length lists** of objects (leptons) within each event—the \"jagged\" structure.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Flattening and Event ID Reconstruction (The Core Transformation)\n",
    "\n",
    "This is the central logic, converting the Awkward Array into a flat, tabular format ready for Pandas.\n",
    "\n",
    "It calculates `lepton_counts` by getting the length of the list of $p_T$ values (`ak.num(raw_data[f'{lepton_prefix}_pt'])`) for each event. This count is essential for the row-wise mapping.\n",
    "\n",
    "Then, the scalar **`event` ID** is converted to a NumPy array and  `np.repeat(event_ids_np, lepton_counts_np)` is used to **duplicate the event ID** for every lepton it contains. If event 123 has 3 leptons, the ID 123 appears 3 times. This creates the primary key for the flat table.\n",

    "    1.  `ak.flatten(...)` converts the jagged array (list of lists) into a single, contiguous 1D array of particle properties.\n",
